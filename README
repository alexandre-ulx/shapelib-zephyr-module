Shapelib portable for zephyr rtos
========================================

Shapelib is a lightweight, C-based library designed for reading and writing ESRI Shapefiles (.shp), which are widely used in GIS applications.
It provides a simple API for handling shape geometries and associated attribute data, making it easy to integrate into embedded systems, desktop applications, and cross-platform environments.

This version includes adaptations for Zephyr RTOS for reading shapefiles from embedded storage systems like FatFS or LittleFS.
